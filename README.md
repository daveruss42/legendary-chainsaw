Hello Collaborators - Please join me in a quest to solve a challenging problem that will help fill a current void to establish a capability to conduct aerial remote sensing to monitor plant chlorophyl production.  I have not programmed a computer for many years (ie, BASIC and FORTRAN), so am not up to speed with current languages.

My name is Dave and I'm looking for help to create a new means to synch two cameras (the current tests are using GoPro cameras) so that photo images can be taken simultaneously from a single command.  I'd like to eventually have something that can be used with any camera pair (two of the same camera type), but we can start with the GoPros.  This is the initial problem statement.  If anyone is interested, please feel free to contact me for questions/clarification.
